<a id="About"></a> 
## ðŸ“ƒ About
This is a project to try and test distributed locks using Redis. There's 2 services(orders and invoices) that have CRUD operations and 
one update or delete request should reflect in both systems avoiding inconsistency. See the <a href="#Endpoints">endpoints</a> section
for more details.

<a id="Endpoints"></a> 
## ðŸ’» Endpoints

In this section you will see informations about the endpoints. There's mermaids sequenceDiagram to ilustrate all the steps.
You can check the mermaid's doc <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html">here</a> and the online editor <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html"> here</a> 

The intentions of these sequenceDiagrams are to show the communications between the components and demonstrating the 'happy path' of each flow. For more details, you should look into the code.

<h4>Create order</h4>

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  client->>+order_service: POST /orders
  order_service->>+invoice_service: POST /invoices
  invoice_service->>+invoice_database: save invoice
  invoice_database-->>-invoice_service: invoice saved
  invoice_service-->>-order_service: invoice created
  order_service->>+order_database: save order 
  order_database-->>-order_service: order saved
  order_service-->>-client: order created
```
---

<h4>Delete order</h4>

```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
    client->>+order_service: DELETE /orders/:id
    order_service->>+order_database: find order by ID
    order_database->>-order_service: return order
    order_service->>+lock_database: Try lock for order and invoice by it's respective ID
    lock_database-->>-order_service: locks resource
    order_service->>+invoice_service: DELETE /invoices/:id
    invoice_service->>+lock_database: Checks if invoice is locked
    lock_database-->>-invoice_service: if invoice is locked, continue
    invoice_service->>+invoice_database: deletes invoice
    invoice_database-->>-invoice_service: invoice deleted
    invoice_service-->>-order_service: invoice deleted
    order_service->>+order_database: delete order 
    order_database-->>-order_service: order deleted
    order_service->>+lock_database: remove locks
    lock_database-->>-order_service: locks removed
    order_service-->>-client: order deleted
```
