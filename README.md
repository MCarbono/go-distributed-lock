<a id="About"></a> 
## ðŸ“ƒ About
This is a project to try and test distributed locks using Redis. There's 2 services(orders and invoices) that have CRUD operations and 
one update or delete request should reflect in both systems avoiding inconsistency. See the <a href="#Endpoints">endpoints</a> section
for more details.

## ðŸ’» Endpoints

In this section you will see informations about the endpoints. There's mermaids sequenceDiagram to ilustrate all the steps.
You can check the mermaid's doc <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html">here</a> and the online editor <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html"> here</a>
